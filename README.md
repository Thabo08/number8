**number8** is an application that allows you to view football statistics across major football leagues around the world.
The application is **work in progress** and many things might not work at times. 

The backend applications get the underlying data from [api-football](https://www.api-football.com "API Football"). The front-end
application(s) (mobile and web (?)) pull the standings data from the backend applications.
